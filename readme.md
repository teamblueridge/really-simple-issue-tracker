#Very Simple Issue Tracker
<p>Keep track of issues, attach them to projects and set time, priority, status and type. Create issues like posts or pages.</p>
<p>Issues are displayed on the http://yoursite.com/issue page, like normal posts. Use the [issue-table] shortcode to get a table style.
To let anonymous users report issues, add a new page with the shortcode [report-issue].</p>
<p>You can also insert two widgets in your site. One for a list of issues and another displays time, status, priority, ... on issue details.</p>

##Installation and updating
- Requirements: PHP 5.2 or later
- Click on zip to download a snapshot of this repository. Then go to your admin, add plugin, and go to upload.
- Find the just downloaded zip and let it install. Activate the plugin and you will now find a new tab at the left of your admin page.

##Changelog
1. Initial clone
	1. Issue table, code cleanup and more
		1. Issue details widget	
	2. Anonymous issue reporting

##Remarks
- The table is limited to 20 entries by now. Fixing this is on my to-do list.
- Using the anonymous posting is not recommended. You will get a lot of spam. In future spam won't get in your site.
- The plugin doesn't have any settings, also this is something for the future.
