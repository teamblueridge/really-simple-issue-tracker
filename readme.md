Very Simple Issue Tracker
=========================
Keep track of issues, attach them to projects and set time, priority, status and type. Posting issues is as easy as creating posts or pages.
Issues are displayed on the http://yoursite.com/issue page, like normal posts. To get a nice table layout however, use the [issue-table] shortcode.
To let anonymous users report issues, add a new page with the shortcode [report-issue]. Optionally, there are two widgets to insert in your site.
One can display a list of issues. The other one is used on single issue pages and displays the time, status, priority, ...

#Installation and updating
Requirements: PHP 5.2 or later
Click on zip to download a snapshot of this repository. Then go to your admin, add plugin, and go to upload.
Find the just downloaded zip and let it install. Activate the plugin and you will now find a new tab at the left of your admin page.

#Changelog
1.0		Initial clone
1.1		Issue table, code cleanup and more
1.1.1	Issue details widget	
1.2 	Anonymous issue reporting

#Remarks
- The table is limited to 20 entries by now. Fixing this is on my to-do list.
- Using the anonymous posting is not recommended. You will get a lot of spam. In future spam won't get in your site.
- The plugin doesn't have any settings, also this is something for the future.

#Reporting features or bugs
For now, use the github bugtracker, or reply on the WordPress topic.
Soon you can use our own site, get a look to see the plugin in action over there.
